# Website-Frontend

The original website that I chose to redesign (www.Xcelstudio.online) was based on WordPress. I rebuilt it using Drag and drop builder and some Html, CSS, JS libraries and bootstrap code. 
The original site included many pages, and this new site has 3 pages. I placed a Nav bar to navigate easily through one page section to section.
The original site didnâ€™t have any filter so I decided to add filter function in my new one which you can see under portfolio section of my site.
I just wanted to showcase my skills on my site and wanted to make it compact, dynamic, more responsive, and less to navigate. So I used few JS libraries to trigger these functions and make the site more attractive.
